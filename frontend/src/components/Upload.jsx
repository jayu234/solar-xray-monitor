                        Solar flares are caused by the Sun’s magnetic field and can disrupt or even destroy infrastructure on Earth. Predicting such events has been challenged by a lack of high-resolution solar data, which has only existed since 2010. Through deep learning, FDL’s Super-resolution team was able to extract information from low-resolution images to obtain a deeper understanding of solar-magnetic activity that better accounts for solar flares.
